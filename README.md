# udisks-rofi
Simple shell script to manage your mounts with udisks via rofi/dmenu

# Howto
Map the script to some key in i3 or other desktop you use. It will show a popup menu. Selecting a device will unmount it (if mounted), or unmount it (if mounted).

Doesn't really get any simpler than this. No nodejs deps, no BS dependencies. You only need rofi or dmenu (replacement in script is left as an exercise for the reader).
